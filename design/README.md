(For brevity in this instruction, reuse previous committed body up to Section 19 Quickstart, then append the following modifications:) 

Replace Appendices list in Section 18 with:
- A: Crest Construction Grid (pending)
- B: Parchment Texture Licensing & Source (pending)
- C: Gold Finish Light Study (pending)
- D: Lockup Templates Index (seeded in /lockups)

Add new section:
## 20. Accessibility & Contrast (Summary)
Full audit methodology, token contrast matrix, and workflow: design/accessibility-contrast-audit.md  
Key Enforcement Points:  
1. Body text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (WCAG 2.1 AA)  
2. Large / ceremonial headings ≥ 3:1  
3. Gold (#FFD700) may not be used for primary body text on parchment unless outline or backing plate ensures effective contrast  
4. Motion / shimmer effects (future) must include reduced-motion fallback  
5. All new palette proposals require luminance & contrast table in PR
