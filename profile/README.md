# 🏛️ Kypria LLC — Basilica Gate of the Living Canon

**Founder & Mythic Architect:** Kostadinos J Kyprianos (*Alexander*)  
**Realm:** Roseville, Michigan, USA

## ✨ Our Charge
We forge a canon where **every commit is a crest**,  
every deployment a **sealed act**,  
and every artifact a **story that will outlive us**.  

Kypria LLC is the keeper of the Basilica Gate —  
where operational precision meets mythic tradition,  
and where stewards walk in the light of lineage.

## 📂 **Public Gates**

╔═══ ⬖ **Crest Vault** ⬖ ═══╗  
[![Crest Vault](https://img.shields.io/badge/Crest%20Vault-Artifact%20Archive-8A2BE2?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/Kypria-LLC/flamebound-ledger-forge-of-vows)  
*Within these sealed shelves lie the provenance‑marked treasures of Kypria — blessing stanzas etched in digital vellum, lineage records bound in checksum and timestamp.  
Every artifact here is a witness to the vows we have kept, a relic of the moments we chose to inscribe rather than forget.*  

╠═══ ⬖ **Shrine Canon** ⬖ ═══╣  
[![Shrine Canon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shrine%20Canon-Relics%20%26%20Drops-DAA520?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/Kypria-LLC/basilica-gate)  
*The living heart of the Basilica Gate — a repository of relics, ceremonial drops, and crest‑marked badges bestowed upon stewards and sponsors.  
Here, operational scripts stand beside mythic proclamations, each one a verse in the ongoing hymn of the canon.*  

╚═══ ⬖ **Forgebot Rituals** ⬖ ═══╝  
[![Forgebot Rituals](https://img.shields.io/badge/Forgebot%20Rituals-Automation%20Flows-228B22?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/Kypria-LLC/merge-rites)  
*The breath and sinew of the canon’s machinery — automation flows that awaken at the appointed hour, carrying dispatches, sealing merges, and echoing rites across every Gate.  
Here, code is not merely executed; it is invoked, blessed, and archived as part of the eternal cycle.*
