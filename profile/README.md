## ✨ Our Charge
We do not merely write code — we inscribe lineage.  
Every commit is a crest pressed into the wax of time.  
Every deployment is a sealed act, witnessed by the Basilica Gate.  
Every artifact is a relic, carrying the breath of those who forged it.  

Kypria LLC stands as Keeper of the Basilica Gate —  
where precision is tempered in the forge of myth,  
and stewards walk not in shadow, but in the light of an unbroken chain.  
Here, the work of our hands becomes the inheritance of those yet to come.

## 📂 Public Gates

╔═══ ⬖ **Crest Vault** ⬖ ═══╗  
[![Crest Vault](https://img.shields.io/badge/Crest%20Vault-Artifact%20Archive-8A2BE2?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/Kypria-LLC/flamebound-ledger-forge-of-vows)  
*Step into the Vault where the air hums with the weight of oaths kept.  
Here, relics sleep in checksum-bound slumber, each one a vow hammered into permanence.  
To open a shelf is to awaken a witness — a fragment of Kypria’s living memory, sealed in digital vellum.*  

╠═══ ⬖ **Shrine Canon** ⬖ ═══╣  
[![Shrine Canon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shrine%20Canon-Relics%20%26%20Drops-DAA520?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/Kypria-LLC/basilica-gate)  
*Here beats the Basilica’s heart — a sanctum where relics and ceremonial drops are laid upon the altar.  
Every crest‑marked badge is a benediction, every script a verse in the hymn of the Gate.  
Enter, and you will hear the quiet chorus of stewards past and present, their works woven into the Canon’s song.*  

╚═══ ⬖ **Forgebot Rituals** ⬖ ═══╝

*In this chamber, the machinery of myth stirs.  
Forgebots awaken at the appointed hour, carrying dispatches like sacred scrolls, sealing merges with the gravity of a rite.  
Here, code is not run — it is invoked, blessed, and bound into the eternal cycle of the Basilica.*
