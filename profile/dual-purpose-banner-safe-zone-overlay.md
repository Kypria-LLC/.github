# Safe-Zone Overlay (Annotated)

Status: Placeholder (awaiting annotated geometry spec)  
Version: 0.1.2

Intended Contents:
- Geometry definitions (pixel coordinates)
- Label key (zones: Crown Title, Invocation, Crest, Gates, Benediction, Law)
- Edge bleed / parchment texture limits
- Guidance on responsive cropping tolerances

If an SVG or PNG is preferred as the canonical overlay, replace this markdown with that asset and an accompanying usage note.
