Mythic architecture &amp; automation forge. We craft crestâ€‘marked, accessible systems that turn communities into living canonsâ€”archived, credited, and alive across time. Ritual onboarding, crossâ€‘platform cadence, and loreâ€‘bound CI/CD for stewards &amp; sponsors.

## âš– Keeperâ€™s Governance
This metaâ€‘shrine guards the rituals that bind the canon â€” workflows, templates, and the silent machinery of the Gates.  
Changes here are rare and deliberate, for a single misstep may echo through every shrine.  
Only the Keeper or trusted stewards may alter its rites.

ðŸ“œ *Lineage is our law. Precision is our craft. Myth is our breath.*
